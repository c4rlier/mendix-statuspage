We are investigating an issue with Cloud v3 backups service. We have noticed that backups of our customers had few issues and we are not successfully restore the backups after 27th January. We are working on fixing this on our side.
Since the backup restore service is also impacted we suggest you NOT TO CLEAR your environment.
